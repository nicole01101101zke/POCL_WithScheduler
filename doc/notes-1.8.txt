Portable Computing Language (PoCL) v1.8 released
------------------------------------------------

PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
OpenCL standard (1.2 with some 2.0 and 3.0 features supported).

In addition to being an easily portable multi-device (truly
heterogeneous) open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of this
project is improving interoperability for diversity of OpenCL-capable
devices by integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform.
Another key goal is to enhance performance portability of OpenCL
programs across device types utilizing runtime and compiler techniques.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
HSA-supported GPUs and ASIPs (experimental, see:
http://openasip.org). It is also known to have multiple (private)
adaptations in active production use.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 13.0
* Improved debugging support with Valgrind, LTTNG
* Improved support for NetBSD, Mac OS X
* Improved support for SPIR/SPIR-V on CUDA

Misc. Notes
-----------

* Please note that there's an official PoCL "maintenance policy" in
place. This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite
project that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future PoCL
releases: http://portablecl.org/docs/html/maintainer-policy.html

* We are still looking for an ARM and RISC-V CPU maintainers. If you
are interested in ensuring a PoCL stays stable for these processor
architectures, please let us know!

Customized Parallel Computing (CPC) research group of Tampere
University, Finland leads the development of PoCL on the side and for
the needs of their research projects. This project has received funding
from the ECSEL Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 783162
(FitOptiVis). The JU receives support from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme and Netherlands, Czech Republic,
